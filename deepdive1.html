    <h1 align="middle">Ukraine Conflict: Important Locations</h1>
    
    <img align="middle" src="ukkrainewide.JPG">
    <p>Ukraine was gripped by unrest when President Viktor Yanukovych refused to sign an association agreement with the European Union in late 2013. An organised political movement and protests demanded closer ties with the European Union and the ousting of Yanukovych. This movement was ultimately successful, culminating in the February 2014 revolution, which removed Yanukovych and his governmentfrom power.</p>
    
    <div id="map" align="middle"> </div>
    <p>Following the flight of President Yanukovych in February 2014, protests by pro-Russian and anti-revolution activists began in the largely Russian ethnic region of Crimea. These were followed by demonstrations in cities across eastern and southern Ukraine, including Donetsk, Luhansk, Kharkiv, and Odessa largely along ethnic lines. The situation quickly escalated to open conflict. The map above indicates important events in this conflict.</p>
